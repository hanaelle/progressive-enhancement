           <p>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
            commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. <br>This is most unfortunate.</q>  The farmer said,
            <q>“Maybe.”</q>  The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
            said, <q>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. <br>What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” </q>The farmer again said, <q>“Maybe.”</q>
            
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. <br>The
            neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded,<q>“Maybe.”</q> <br>The next day the conscription
            officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
            the neighbors came around and said, <q>“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said,<q>“Maybe.”</q> 

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether
            anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</p>
